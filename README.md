# Space-Simulator

A simulation showing the planets orbiting the Sun.

We need:
* planets ( let user choose how many )
  * which orbit they are on (distance from sun)
  * the colour (choose hex codes/drop down menu of set colours)
  * the size in comparison to others (or just their radius)
  
* the orbital distances (i dont know what the technical term would be?)
* the scale we will use for size

**TO DO:**
* Figure out trajectory
* Figure out planet speed (some physics equation?? Time to get the A Level phys textbook out
* Have planets move around their own trajectory at right speed
* Tkinter panel that shows information on each planet speed size etc
*Done - Tkinter options panel to add more planets
